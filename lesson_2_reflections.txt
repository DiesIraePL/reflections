1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	After using command git init a new repository is being created but nothing is commited yet. 
	It needs to be done to tell the git files in which repository should be versioned
	
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

	Staging area is a waiting place for files before commit. It helps user to manage what file or
	group of files should be commited each time.
